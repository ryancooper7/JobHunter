# JobHunt
In the job hunt it is often necessary to apply to a large number of companies before receiving offers and making that final decision. This can make it important to track what jobs you have applied to in order to avoid repeat applications, keep track of the interview process, and analyze what type of jobs you have a high success rate with.

Job Hunter is a web application that allows you to easily keep track of all the jobs you have applied to and quickly see your spot in the interview process and your application status. Jobs can be quickly added, edited, and deleted. Jobs are color-coded by your current application status, making for quick visual examination. Users can search through the jobs they have applied to, in order to quickly find and modify a specific job.
